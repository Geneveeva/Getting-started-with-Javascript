Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages?
Answer: dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed       languages perform type checking at compile time.
           Statically typed languages have better performance at run-time and are faster at run-time. It is because there is no need for type checking at run-time, and the code has already been translated. But dynamically-typed languages are comparatively faster during development time and are more flexible.

Examples of Dynamically typed programming languages.
    Python
     JavaScript
     Lisp
     PHP
     Ruby
     Perl,
